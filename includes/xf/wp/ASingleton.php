 * This is an abstract class and is meant to be extended.
 *
 * This class is a combination of two patterns, Singleton and Factory.
 * It lets you only allow one instance of classes.
 * You may extend this class, and as long as you call this constructor or the register method, then the extended class is a Singleton.
 * Any class that is registered as a singleton can only be instantiated once, and this class throws and error if it is tried.
 *
 * This includes the entire class hierarchy for a particular class all the way until but not including this class and it's parents.
 * For the hierarchy of a class registered as a Singleton...
 * All the parent classes that are also registered reference the same instance of the class that is responsible for registering them.
